Totally Pythonic, OpenAPI Based customizable documentation pages for [SwaggerUI], [ReDoc], [RapiDoc], [Elements], [Scalar].

> Keep in mind, that this package doesn't generate [OpenAPI] Spec, it just renders the pages with the given configuration.

## Installation

```console
pip install openapipages
```

## Usage

I know it looks a bit boilerplate but it's all straight-forward. The `.render()` method returns the HTML as a string. Thanks to this design, you can extend and configure the pages as you wish (e.g. add extra logic to restrict access to the page).

### FastAPI

> The `include_in_schema` parameter is set to `False` in each endpoint to avoid including these endpoints in the OpenAPI Spec.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from openapipages import Elements, RapiDoc, ReDoc, Scalar, SwaggerUI

# Disable the built-in /redoc page so we can make a custom one.
app = FastAPI(redoc_url=None)


@app.get("/")
def root() -> dict[str, str]:
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/swaggerui", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
def get_swaggerui() -> str:
    return SwaggerUI(title="Swagger UI").render()


@app.get("/redoc", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
def get_redoc() -> str:
    return ReDoc(title="ReDoc").render()


@app.get("/scalar", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
def get_scalar() -> str:
    return Scalar(title="Scalar").render()


@app.get("/elements", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
def get_elements() -> str:
    return Elements(title="Elements").render()


@app.get("/rapidoc", response_class=HTMLResponse, include_in_schema=False)
def get_rapidoc() -> str:
    return RapiDoc(title="RapiDoc").render()

```

### Litestar

See the [Litestar Example](examples/litestar/README.md) for more details.

## Motivation

TL;DR - I don't want to copy and paste it again...

### Developer Experience

Several API Documentation tools are ready to use at your fingertips with a standard interface.

No more copying and pasting the same thing from one project to another. Import the package and use it!

### Configuration

Here is a pull request made to the [FastAPI] repo. This was the point I understood the configuration was limited and it wouldn't change...

- [Allow passing ui parameters to redoc html by adriantre · Pull Request #10437 · tangelo/fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/10437)

Also, the author's answer to this PR shows that we won't be seeing more alternative documentation tools in the future.

### Alternatives

Here is another pull request made to the [FastAPI] repo. It brings [Scalar] support, but it's not approved/merged yet and I think it will stay that way thanks to the previous PR.

- [feat: add scalar integration (additional alternative to Swagger UI/Redoc) by marclave · Pull Request #10674 · tiangolo/fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/10674)

### Standardisation

> A standard interface for many API Documentation Interfaces with configuration features.

Lately, OpenAPI Spec-based Documentation tools have become popular in the Python community. We see a lot of projects ([FastAPI], [Litestar], [APISpec], [flasgger], [SpecTree], [Connexion], etc) offering support for OpenAPI Specification out of the box.

[Litestar] has support for [SwaggerUI], [ReDoc], [RapiDoc], and [Elements] and [FastAPI] has support for [SwaggerUI], and [ReDoc] but what is next? Will the next one be enough?

They all have one thing in common, some HTML (as Python string or a file) templated with the given configuration.

Do you see where I am going?

I want `openapipages` to be SQLAlchemy of OpenAPI Spec-based Documentation tools.

One interface for many! And of course Framework agnostic... So you can use it in your [FastAPI], [Litestar] projects, or any other project that generates OpenAPI specifications.
